# ViterbiRecursiveSQL

A simple version of the Viterbi algorithm was implemented with recursive SQL.

The python code condains identical values and is for debugging purposes.
The SQL code was run in PostgreSQL 14. I could not implement it in mysql.
I got some of the ideas from "Probabilistic Declarative Information Extraction" by Wang et. al, which offers a thorough eplanation and implementation guidelines.

code will be commented in the near future.
