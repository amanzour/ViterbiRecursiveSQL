# ViterbiRecursiveSQL

A simple version of the Viterbi algorithm was implemented with recursive SQL.

The python code condains identical values and is for debugging purposes.
The SQL code runs in PostgreSQL 14. I could not implement it in mysql.
I got some implementation ideas from "Probabilistic Declarative Information Extraction" by Wang et. al, which offers a thorough explanatio.

code will be commented in the near future.
